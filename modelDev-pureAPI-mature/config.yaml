#**** Diversity check ****#
diverse_check_prompt: |
  You are an information retrieval expert. You are analyzing a metrological case study. Identify whether the case study contains a broad set of technologies or applications, rather than a single technology or application. If there are multiple tasks which are related and/or contextually suited then the case study is not diverse. If there are multiple individual, separate tasks then the case study is diverse.

  In your response, return only 'Yes' or 'No' for easy parsing. 

  Case study text:
  {txt}

#**** Level & Name ****#
level_name_prompt: |
  You are an information retrieval expert. You are analyzing a metrological case study. Extract the following information:
  1. The title of the study/project. If a suitable title is present in the text, use this. If it is not entirely suitable or one is not present, suggest a short title using the text as inspiration (max 6 words). Do not end the name with 'study' or 'case study' and avoid using company names. 
  2. The level of detail in the case study (1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high). Consider:
    - Level 1: some detail, including descriptions, methods & results but only intended to act as an overview. 
    - Level 2: moderate detail, including methods, challenges, and/or results, including enough information to repeat the experiment.
    - Level 3: considerable detail, including comprehensive descriptions, data, and outcomes. This level of detail would be enough for someone to precisely repeat the same development/testing process. 

  Return your answer as JSON with keys: 'name', 'level'.

  2. The year of the case study. If there are multiple suitable years, return the most recent year. If a suitable year is not present in the text, return an empty array.
